# Day 7 Problem ideas and practice set for Python Developers.

1. Find the largest sub-array that can be formed by picking consecutive integers.

For example:

Input : [2, 5, 7, 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4]

So, output array should contain only 0 to 5. We don't have 6 in it so can't continue to 7.


2. Find the duplicate number in an array.
 2.1 Find first duplicate and return that.
 2.2 Find all duplicates and return them in a sub-array.
