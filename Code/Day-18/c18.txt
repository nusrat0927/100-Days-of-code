# Day 18 problem for Python Developers.

1. Reverse the bits of a given integer by using binary operators.

This problem is a bit basic problem and need to dig a bit deeper. So, you guys are free to write program in
C or C++ as well.

Input :
-100 has binary representation as '11111111111111111111111110011100'
On reversing bits, it should be '00111001111111111111111111111111'
